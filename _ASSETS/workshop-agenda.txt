    OK 5. data flow:
          Data flows down. Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful
          or stateless, and they shouldn't care whether it is defined as a function or a class.
          This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component
          other than the one that owns and sets it. A component may choose to pass its state down as props
          to its child components:
          This is commonly called a "top-down" or "unidirectional" data flow. Any state is always owned by
          some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components
          "below" them in the tree.

    OK 7. Controlled components:
          In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component.
          A React component that renders a form and also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input
          by supressing the default form behaviour of HTML that opens a new URL in the browser.

    OK 8. Uncontrolled components:
          Does not change state on altering input values.
          But also suppresses the default HTML behaviour of opening a new URL on submitting the form.
